## What is Whois?

`whois` is a website that provides information about domain names, IP addresses, and related entities. It's like a phone book for the internet, allowing you to look up details about a website or IP address.

### How Does Whois Work?

When you perform a `whois` lookup, the service queries a database of domain name and IP address information. This database contains details such as:

- The domain name's registration date
- Expiry date
- Name of the domain registrar
- Name servers
- Contact information for the domain owner

Here is an example of a `whois` lookup for the domain `netcraft.com`:
